# Pygame_Learning
A collection of programs to display the workings of Pygame Library.
<p>Pygame_tut1 creates a window, creates a shape, provides it velocity, assigns events and allows it to move in directions pressed by the user. A decent start to get in sync with PyGame.</p>
<p>Pygame_tut2 creates constraints such that the character/shape cannot leave the window, allows jumping of the shape, when space bar is clicked.</p>
